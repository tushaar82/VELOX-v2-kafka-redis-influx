### Task 2.3: RSI Momentum Strategy (COMPLETED)
**Test Coverage:** 13 unit tests

**Deliverables:**
- `src/adapters/strategy/rsi_momentum.py` - Complete strategy implementation

  - Detailed logging with decision breakdown
  - Position tracking with highest price
  - Signal generation with reasoning

**Entry Logic:**
```
[SIGNAL_CHECK] Symbol @ Price
├─ RSI: value < 30 (oversold) → PASS/FAIL
├─ MA(20): value
├─ Price > MA: check → PASS/FAIL
├─ Volume: value > min → PASS/FAIL
└─ DECISION: GENERATE BUY SIGNAL / NO SIGNAL
```

**Exit Logic:**
```
[EXIT_CHECK] Position: Symbol
├─ Entry: price, Current: price
├─ P&L: percentage (target: 2%)
├─ RSI: value (overbought: 70)
├─ Stop-loss: price
└─ DECISION: SELL / HOLD
```

**Tests:** `tests/test_strategy.py`
- ✓ Strategy initialization
- ✓ Entry on RSI oversold
- ✓ No entry without oversold
- ✓ Exit on target hit
- ✓ Exit on stop-loss hit
- ✓ Exit on RSI overbought
- ✓ Hold when conditions not met
- ✓ Position tracking
- ✓ Position price updates
- ✓ Square-off all positions
- ✓ Strategy activation/deactivation
- ✓ Signal management
- ✓ Volume filtering

**Test Results:** 13/13 passed (100%)
