### Task 2.5: Trailing Stop-Loss Engine ✓
**Test Coverage:** 13 unit tests

2. **ATR** - ATR-based trailing
   - SL = Highest Price - (ATR × Multiplier)

   - Example: Entry 100, ATR=2, Mult=2 → SL=96
   - Price→110 → SL=106 (trails up)

3. **MA** - Moving Average based
   - SL = MA - (MA × Buffer%)
   - Trails with MA movement
   - Example: MA=95, Buffer=1% → SL=94.05

4. **TIME_DECAY** - Tightens over time
   - Starts at initial_sl_pct (2%)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Signal Flow:
Market Data → Strategy → Signal → Risk Manager → Order Manager → Broker
                  ↓                                      ↓
            Indicators                            Position Manager
                                                         ↓
                                                  Trailing SL Manager
```

**Component Interactions:**
1. **Market Data** flows to strategies via Multi-Strategy Manager
2. **Strategies** generate signals based on indicators
3. **Risk Manager** validates signals against limits
4. **Order Manager** executes approved signals via broker
5. **Position Manager** tracks positions per strategy
6. **Trailing SL Manager** monitors and updates stop-losses
7. **Kafka** publishes order fills and position updates
